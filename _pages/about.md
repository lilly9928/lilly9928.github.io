Biography
======
I am PH.D student at [Yonsei University](https://gsi.yonsei.ac.kr/). I received my M.S and B.S in Computer Engineering from [Keimyung University](https://kmu.ac.kr/uni/main/main.jsp), where I was advised by Prof. Deokwoo Lee. 

<!-- My research interest lies in applied machine learning, which aims to develop practical ML solutions for real-world applications. I have covered a wide range of data types (e.g., matrix/tensor, text, graph, time series), tasks (e.g., classification, outcome prediction, anomaly detection, retrieval, data generation), and domains (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing, recommender systems). -->
